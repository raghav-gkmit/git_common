// ***************** Remove directory from remote repository after adding them to .gitignore

// ** I committed and pushed some directory to github. After that, I altered the .gitignore file adding a directory that should be ignored. Everything works fine, but the (now ignored) directory stays on github.

// ******************* To customize your terminal prompt to show the current Git branch name, you can modify your shell configuration. Here’s how to do it for zsh:

Option 1: Using oh-my-zsh
If you’re not already using it, consider installing Oh My Zsh, which makes customizing your prompt easier:

Install Oh My Zsh:

If you don’t have it installed, you can do so with this command:

** bash **

sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

Change Theme:

Oh My Zsh comes with themes that show the current Git branch by default. You can set a theme like agnoster or powerlevel10k. To change the theme:

Open your .zshrc:
** bash **

nano ~/.zshrc
Find the line that starts with ZSH_THEME= and change it to one of the themes that display the branch name, e.g.:

** bash **

ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
Save and exit (Ctrl + O, then Enter, then Ctrl + X).

Source the Configuration:

Run:

** bash **
source ~/.zshrc
